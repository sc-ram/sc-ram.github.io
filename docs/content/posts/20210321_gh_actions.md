Using GitHub Actions with Hugo to build this site

Making use of GitHub actions in combination with Hugo is a nice and easy way to build static web pages. 
The following resources helped to make this really easy:
- [GH actions by peaceiris](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)
- [Hermit Template](https://github.com/Track3/hermit)
- [Nice blog as baseline](https://blog.kye.dev/hugo-github-pages-actions/)
