#My GitHub Pages 

This repository will be used as my development playground for Hugo and GH Actions. 
As nice side effect, it can be used to document some of my projects.

##Getting started

The Hugo page can either be built from GH actions and be served from GH pages.
A simple workflow file is added for this purpose.

For local tests you can use the makefile with the following command. 
It will build the site and serve it locally.

```make run-docs```
